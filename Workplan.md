Current Plan for Project:

Aim is to analyse the beginning of Spring according to temperature, using data from the 'Uppsala' set.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Group members have the following tasks -

Cameron - Using data for the 21st March each year, plot and analyse the temperatures at the vernal equinox (Official start of spring). Will attempt to fit this histogram with an appropriate function. Plan to have developed code to read data into a vector by 17/11/6, generated a histogram by 17/11/7, analysed this and gained appropriate results by 17/11/8.

Louise -

Viktor- Goal: Create code which determine at what date the average temperature is above 0 and below 10, for 7 days in a row. This is SMHI:s definition of spring.
Plott distribution of days for when spring arrives of each year.
